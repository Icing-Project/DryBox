# DryBox Graph Test Scenario
# This scenario has non-zero loss, jitter, and reorder rates to visualize on graphs

mode: byte                  # "byte" mode shows more network metrics
duration_ms: 30000          # 30 seconds - enough time to see trends
seed: 42

# --- Network settings with impairments for visible graph data ---
network:
  bearer: volte_evs
  loss_rate: 0.05           # 5% packet loss - will show on graphs
  latency_ms: 50            # 50ms latency
  jitter_ms: 15             # 15ms jitter - will vary over time
  reorder_rate: 0.02        # 2% reorder rate - will show on graphs
  ge_p_good_bad: 0.01       # Gilbert-Elliott: higher transition to bad state
  ge_p_bad_good: 0.2        # Gilbert-Elliott: recovery from bad state
